This is my second year at GSoC and I'm excited to work with [Drupal][drupal] this year. Drupal is an open source content management platform powering millions of websites and applications. It's primarily built on PHP.

This time I'll be working on making an [Elasticsearch][elasticsearch] module for Drupla 8. Drupal 8 is still in development and hasn't been released yet as a stable version. There has been a huge improvement in D8 comapred to D7. Drupal 8 introduces file-based configuration management system and use of the Symfony2 framework.

I've used [Elasticsearch Connector][elasticsearch-connector] module as a base and planned to port it to D8 with [Search API Sandbox][search-api] and [Composer Manager][composer-manager] as dependency modules.

Refer the [project page][project-page] about developments of the project.
