This is my personal website where I post random writings. I love fiddling with code, traveling and [photography](http://instagram.com/xan_ps).

I am interested in building fast and reliable search systems having extensive experience with Elasticsearch and Apache Solr. 

According to history, I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India after (somehow) managing to complete my Bachelors in Technology (Civil Engineering 2010-2014).

I also contribute to Open Source, namely [Drupal](https://drupal.org) and [Moodle](https://moodle.org).
