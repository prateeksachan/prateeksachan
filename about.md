This is my personal website where I post random writings. I love fiddling with code, traveling and [photography](http://instagram.com/xan_ps).

Currently, I live in Gurgaon and work as a Software Engineer at [Zomato](https://zomato.com).

Officially on paper, I'm a Civil Engineer (2010-2014) graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India.

I also contribute to Open Source, namely [Drupal](https://drupal.org) and [Moodle](https://moodle.org).

Feel free to contact me.
